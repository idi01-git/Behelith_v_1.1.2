# ✨ Why Behelith?

Competitive programmers spend countless hours switching between editors, browsers, formatters, templates, and testing tools.

Behelith removes that friction.

Powered by the **Monaco Editor** (the editor behind VS Code), Behelith transforms the default Codeforces experience into a modern competitive programming workspace directly inside your browser.

No external APIs.

No online formatters.

No context switching.

Just open a problem and start coding.

# 🔒 Security

### Sandbox Isolation

Browsers restrict direct execution features through Content Security Policies.

Behelith uses:

* Isolated iframe architecture
* Structured postMessage communication
* Browser-compliant WebAssembly execution

### Native Messaging

Local execution uses Chrome's official Native Messaging protocol.

Temporary files are automatically cleaned after execution.
